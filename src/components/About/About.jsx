        My mom, my brother, and I, We got Kaya when she was 2 years old. For me I was still grieving the passing of our seven year old Rottweiler/Aussie Shepard mix Bongo. 
        I wasn't ready for another dog. Regardless of whether I was ready, Kaya came into our lives and made it greater despite all the hardships we all endrured. 
        In life Kaya loved games, her favorites included playing fetch, tug-o-war, and hide and seek(with her toys). She also loved to jump in between a fight between two of
        her toys and take a side. This website is game review site dedicated to her memory. while it these weren't the games she played, The reviews are written from the point
        of view I imagined she would have had. My other dogs would have probably been a lot harsher on these games, but Kaya always loved to play. We love you Kaya.
